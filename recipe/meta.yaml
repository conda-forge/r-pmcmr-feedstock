  summary: "Note, that the 'PMCMR' package is superseded by the novel 'PMCMRplus' package. The 'PMCMRplus' package contains all functions from  'PMCMR' and many more parametric and non-parametric multiple comparison procedures, one-factorial trend tests, as well as improved method functions,  such as print, summary and plot.\
    \  The 'PMCMR' package is no longer maintained, but kept for compatibility of reverse depending packages for some time. "
